### Norah's life reflected deep conviction and selfless love from an early age.

On Feb. 28, 2025, at 9:08 a.m., Norah Celeste returned to her Heavenly Father, leaving a beautiful legacy of love, faith, and service. Born on Valentine’s Day in San Francisco de Macoris, Dom., from an early age, she embodied the purest kind of love, the kind that gives selflessly with empathy.

Norah was a model student and an accomplished athlete. She loved playing the cello and the piano and had a deep passion for reading, soccer, and track and field. She also loved spending time with her sisters, go on family vacations, and reading book series.

At the age of eight, Norah was baptized by her father in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She lived her faith with quiet strength, always finding joy in lifting others and offering kindness and encouragement wherever she went. Norah’s love for her Heavenly Father was boundless, and her faith remained unshakable until the end.

Although Norah has physically left this world, her spirit lives on in the lives she touched. Rise for Hope endeavors to love and serve as she did.

[[Every life we touch honors Norah's.]]
