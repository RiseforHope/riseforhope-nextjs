## A New Chapter

Welcome to the new digital home of Rise for Hope. While our work is rooted in face-to-face connection, we needed a place to share the tangible impact of your generosity.

**Our mission is specific:** We do not fund research. We fund families facing the devastation of pediatric cancer. 100% of public donations go directly to their immediate needs (mortgages, bills, and groceries) so they can focus on their child.

## What You Will Find Here

* **Real Impact:** Stories of resilience from the families we serve.
* **Transparency:** Clear updates on where every dollar goes.
* **Action:** Upcoming events and ways to help right now.

We honor Norah, and every life we touch honors hers. Thank you for walking this path with us.
